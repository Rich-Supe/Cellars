Github Workflow:

Make a new branch locally : git branch <name>
and git checkout <name> 

or

git checkout -b <name> into the created branch, 

Add a new branch per feature, use git branch to determine the current branch

After pushing a branch, open a pull request on Github
(deal with merge conflicts and double-check code)
Accept pull request & merge

checkout into master from the local repo

git pull origin master from Github

checkout into branch, finish feature before merging.
